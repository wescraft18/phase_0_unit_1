* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

- Click on the new repository link located near the bottom right-hand corner of github.com after you have logged-in.  Name your new repository, and select whether you would like it to be available to the public or kept private.  You should create a README that explains what the repository is, and possibly how to use the install/use the code in the repository.  Next, select which license you would like to use for the code in your new repository.
- Open source is sharing how a program was made, and allowing others to edit and customize it.
- I like the idea of Open Source.  Through collaboration we can reach new heights.
- Using licenses is important because it specifically defines how your code can and should be used and distributed.
- The different licenses and their applications were solidified in the challenge.  I had never encountered them before, so determining their differences was very helpful.
- No better resources found.
