- I was able to find answers to my questions using google.  stackoverflow.com was my main source to clear up confusion.
	- My questions included:
		- How to float to divs side-by-side?
		- How to contain to divs in a static div?
		- How to make the static container div non-destructive?
- I really struggled at floating the sidebar and content divs in the same container div.  Luckily I was able to find a few great answers on stackoverflow.com that eventually cleared up my confusion.  I am still struggling with the :visited psuedo-selector, but plan to do more tinkering with it.
- I learned a number of new skills, such as: 
	- How to contain two floating divs in a container div.
	- Furthered my understanding of padding and other styling.
	- How to use psuedo-selectors in css to make my page interactive.
- I feel confident with the Learning Competencies for this challenge, other than brushing up some more on psuedo-selectors.
- I enjoyed all of the challenge.
- I found containing my floating divs in a static div to be the most tedious.  But that is mostly attributed to my previous confusion with the topic.
