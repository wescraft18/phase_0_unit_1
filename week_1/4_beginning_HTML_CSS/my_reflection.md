## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

- I understand how HTML is formatted and where the basic elements belong.  After working through codecademy's course and the resource material solidified my understanding of HTML syntax.  I am still confused about how to organize divs.
- HTML seems like a great was to construct the framework of a webpage.  I'm not sure what would be bad at this point.
- I had an "aha" moment when I realized how css selectors work to style the HTML content.
- Working through the codecademy course gave me the extra repetition I need to really hit home with the syntax.
