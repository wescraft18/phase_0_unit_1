## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

- I learned the basic differences between client-side and server-side languages, and how they might be used.  I also learned how a local name server uses a domain name to track down the IP address and get it back to the computer for the user.
- One important thing to remember is, what do you want the user experience to be like (how will the site be layed out to maximize user experience).  Another important thing to remember is not everyone has the latest browers to work with all the cool things HTML5 can do.  It is important to add backword capability with Modernizr.js.
- It felt great to see that beast of a site go live!
- I had multiple 'aha' moments, especially while reading how that cool local name server works.  
- No additional resources to list at this time.
