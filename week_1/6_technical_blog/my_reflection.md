Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

- I never blog, so this was an interesting assignment for me.  Setting up the page was fun, but actually writing about the websites didn't feel very natural.  I'll be adding that to the pile of things to practice.
